Project Concept:
A bobblehead acts as a live lie detector for statements made by politicians. In this prototype, three buttons correspond to statements made by Donald Trump, Joe Biden, and Elon Musk. When a button is pressed, a statement will play through the speaker, with the bobblehead moving if the statement is false and staying still if the statement is true.

This lie detector is designed for use at community town halls and public awareness events, fostering discussions on the importance of transparency and fact-checking political claims in an engaging way. It targets the attendees of these events, especially younger crowds, encouraging them to critically evaluate the statements made by politicians.



Three Statements Used:
1. "In Springfield (Ohio), they're eating the dogs, the people that came in, they're eating the cats. They're eating, they're eating the pets of the people that live there.”
- Donald Trump
Rating: Pants on Fire

2. "President Joe Biden’s immigration policy was “a giant voter importation scam.”"
- Elon Musk
Rating: Pants on Fire

3. “Violent crime is near a record 50-year low.”
- Joe Biden
Rating: True
